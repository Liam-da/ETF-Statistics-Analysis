# ETF Statistics Analysis

This project analyzes weekly return data from a selection of Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) using Python.  
The analysis includes descriptive statistics, distribution assessment, portfolio optimization, and inference using confidence intervals.

##  Dataset
- Weekly ETF returns from 2006–2015  
- 454 observations for each ETF  
- ETFs analyzed: **AGG**, **VAW**, **IWN**, **SPY**

## Project Components
### 1. Descriptive Statistics
- Summary statistics for weekly returns  
- Density plots and boxplots  
- Scatterplots for pairwise relationships  
(See PDF report for figures.)

### 2. Portfolio Construction
- Covariance and correlation matrix  
- Six ETF pair portfolios  
- Portfolio variance minimization  
- Optimal weights and minimum variance tables

### 3. Distribution Analysis
- Histogram and QQ-plots  
- Normality assessment for AGG, VAW, IWN, SPY  
- Use of Central Limit Theorem for inference  

### 4. Confidence Intervals
- 95% confidence intervals for expected weekly returns  
- Interpretation of uncertainty and volatility
